wurlf-service is a web service that takes a user agent string and returns
an object describing the user agent and its capabilities.

The wurfl.py file is generated by the wurfl2python.py script, which comes with
pywurfl.  It is used to along with pywurfl to automate the detection of mobile
user agents.

Rationale:

The wurfl module created by wurfl2python.py is not small.  It takes time to
import and occupies memory.  Wrapping it in a web service allows multiple
applications to use it.
